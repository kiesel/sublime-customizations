These are my personal SublimeText2 settings w/ snippets and stuff. Feel free to use if you like, but don't blame for any breakage.

Installation
---
1. Go to your `Package` directory, by selecting `Preferences > Browse packages ...`
2. Close SublimeText2
3. Move the `User` directory to somewhere else to have a backup.
4. Go to the `Package` directory on commandline and do

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:kiesel/sublime-customizations.git User
Cloning into 'User'...

remote: Total 11 (delta 4), reused 10 (delta 3)
Receiving objects: 100% (11/11), done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (4/4), done.
```

That's it.
